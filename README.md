Completing the Hello World tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

I have traditionally been a telecommunications field tech, but am currently in a network engineer role. Or at least that is what my company calls me. =)

I am learning python right now, primarily through JetBrains Academy. I completed the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, and will complete the tasks there once I am done here. After getting a pretty good grasp on python I plan on working on html/php/css.
